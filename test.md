# A Journey Into Finding Vulnerabilities in the PMB Library Management System

## Introduction
The following research was conducted by Nexaâ€™s security team with the goal to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the security of open-source software and protect the organizations that rely on them.

In the search for open source projects to look for vulnerabilities, the idea of reviewing the code of a library system called PMB used by several well-known organizations came up. PMB, being an open-source project, provides an excellent opportunity for security researchers to study its codebase, identify potential vulnerabilities, and contribute to its security.

According to Wikipedia, "PMB is a fully featured open source integrated library system. It is continuously developed and maintained by the French company PMB Services."

For instance, using the following Google Dork, almost 5 million results were obtained, which indicates the widespread use of this software.

## Plan
The objective was to find critical impact vulnerabilities that would allow bypassing authentication and subsequently achieve remote command execution using authenticated components.

Authenticated and unauthenticated components

## Setup
In order to conduct the research, a local environment composed of the following was prepared:
 - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instance.
 - PHP modules required to use the software (PMB).
 - A database server (MariaDB) with logging enabled to analyze the SQL queries performed by the application.
 - Xdebug and Visual Studio Code to debug the application.

## Results

The summary of the identified vulnerabilities is listed below (for PMB version 7.4.7 and earlier).

**Pre-authenticated vulnerabilities**
